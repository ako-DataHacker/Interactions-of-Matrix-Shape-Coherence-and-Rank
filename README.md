# Interactions-of-Matrix-Shape-Coherence-and-Rank

This is the Capstone Project at UTD 2021. I collaborated with Adam Shaker, David Terry, and our advisor Yifei Lou to explore the different methods of matrix completion to find the most optimal way to complete the matrix.

Abstract
In this project, we explore matrix completion for recommender systems. Using synthetic data and real datasets such as Amazon, Netflix, MovieLens, we draw the relations among matrix coherence, rank, and regularization models in order to understand matrix recovery. We observe that the most-squared matrix tends to give the highest accuracy for matrix completion via nuclear norm minimization, which can be justied by matrix coherence. Most matrix completion techniques rely on singular value decomposition (SVD). We nd that an approximated scheme of SVD is not only faster but also better than the standard SVD. Lastly, we discover that the TL1 model achieves the best matrix recovery results among some existing approaches such as nuclear norm and Lp Schatten norm.
